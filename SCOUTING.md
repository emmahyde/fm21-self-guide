## Scouting Hints and Tips in FM for beginners
When viewing your club screen you can find out the level of scouting knowledge your club has by viewing the ‘Knowledge’ sub-tab from the ‘Scouting’ tab.

Your club’s level of scouting knowledge can be increased by either signing scouts who already have a large knowledge base, acquiring an affiliate club or by sending your existing scouts out to investigate new territories.

Scouting your next opposition will give you an insight into their tactics and key players and help you plan your tactical approach for the game.

If you are managing a national team, it is possible for you to scout players eligible for selection.

Scouting hints and tips in FM for advanced players
Parent clubs automatically expand their scouting network by using scouting knowledge from feeder clubs.

When signing scouts from a foreign country, your team will benefit from the scout’s knowledge of players from that nation.

Scouting a player more than once will increase the likelihood of the scout finding out more about his strengths and weaknesses.

The more scouting knowledge your club has, the more players will appear on the player search screen.

Assigning a scout to ‘Scout Next Opposition’ and to a country/region in another continent will result in that scout spending a lot of time travelling rather than actually scouting players.

You can change which scout closely tracks and follows the progress of any of your players out on loan by clicking ‘Team’ > ‘Staff Responsibilities’ and then choosing your desired scout in the ‘Scouting’ section.

To scout a team, select the ‘Scout’ menu from the Actions area of their ‘Overview’ screen and choose the member of staff you wish to compile the report.

To scout a competition, select the ‘Get Scout Report’ item from the Actions area of its ‘Overview’ screen and choose the member of staff you wish to compile the report.
